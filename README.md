# Melanoma_Detection_Assignment
This project focuses on classifying skin cancer images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used is from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive. Data augmentation techniques, along with dropout, batch normalization, and L2 regularization, were applied to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.
